% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

\section {Application domain}
A jet fighter game in which the player controls a jet fighter. \newline
First the player has to take off (from an aircraft carrier). Next the player has to complete some objectives (destroying enemy planes, bombing targets on the ground). And finally the player has to land safely.

There is also a two player option, in which one player controls the plane and the other player controls the weapons.

\section {Challenges}
The main challenge is mapping all the different actions (navigating the jet, shooting weapons, switching weapons, \dots). Ideally the player could navigate the plane and simultaneously shoot and select enemy plane. But this requires a lot of gestures and it might be difficult for the user to do multiple actions simultaneously.

Another challenge is selecting target enemy planes. There can be multiple planes and they can be rather small. We have to find a way to easily select enemies and confirm the selection (so the player doesn't accidentally select a wrong plane while trying to select another plane or doing another action).

\section {Interaction techniques}
The game needs to support a lot of actions (see table \ref{tblActions}).
[We've got some ideas, but we first want to discuss them during the lecture]
