# jet-fighter-kinect
University group project for the course "3D Interaction and Virtual Environments"

We developed a first person jet fighter game in Unity, which would be solely controlled via the Microsoft Kinect.  
A small paper about the process and results can be found [here](https://github.com/jbrulmans/jet-fighter-kinect/blob/master/Verslag/verslag.pdf).
